First i created all the variables so that my generator had passwords to choose from. 
then in the function i put a prompt to show the user that he needed tochoose a password between 8 and 128 characters and if he didnt he would be returned to the start.
then imade the statements true and created a for loop so that if i was less than the password length it would choose a random number.
